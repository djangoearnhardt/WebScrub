Python Selenium Script For Box Office Testing

The Aspen Music Festival and School publishes a calendar of events each winter. There are five or more pass holder levels
and each level gets particular discounts and privileges. 

My script runs through the events and adds the pass holder discounts to test if they were created correctly. 

It prints out the results and box office staff can verify.

It saves the organization time and money by going through the season calendar and testing all the events with pass holder levels
much quicker than an individual could. It also allows peace of mind for finance and box office before the full calendar 
is available for the public to interact with.
