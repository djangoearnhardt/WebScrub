Python Selenium Script For Box Office Calendar

The Aspen Music Festival and School publishes a calendar of events each winter for their summer season (over 150 events). There are 10 or more pass holder levels and each level gets particular discounts and privileges. 

My script runs through the events and adds the pass holder discounts to test if they were created correctly. 

It prints out the results which the box office and finance staff can verify.

It saves the organization time and money by going through the season calendar and testing all the events with pass holder levels much quicker than an individual could. It also allows peace of mind for finance and box office before the full calendar 
is available for the public to interact with.
